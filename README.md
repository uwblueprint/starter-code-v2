# Starter-Code v2

Starter-code for our projects, brought to you by the @uwblueprint/internal-tools team!

To update the release branch with commits from main:
1. Create a new branch off the release branch
2. Merge main into the new branch
3. Open a PR from your new branch -> release branch
4. Reviewers should be able to see just the changes from the new main commits
5. Merge the PR, it should just show up as a single commit in the commit history of the release branch
