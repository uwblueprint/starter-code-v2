## How to use this interface

Link interface. Eg. [TypeScript User Auth interface](https://github.com/uwblueprint/starter-code-v2/blob/0e2d6af6ead206750c58f44d5d98e27c05428dfd/backend/typescript/services/interfaces/authService.ts)
What the function does, the params, and what it returns will already be found there.
Could also just copy/paste the interface here

Think of a way the method might be used in the app and write a short code sample. Explain when the method might be used.
List all the methods included if helpful to explain beyond what's part of the interface

### method_name(param1: string, param2: int)
