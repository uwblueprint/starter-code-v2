# Database Migrations

If you are using a relational database (i.e. PostgreSQL), it is helpful to use migrations to manage schema changes. For each of Starter Code's backend choices, a schema migration tool has been included, which interfaces with each backend's respective ORM (Sequelize for TypeScript and SQLAlchemy for Python). Please check each backend's corresponding migration docs for instructions on how to run migrations.
