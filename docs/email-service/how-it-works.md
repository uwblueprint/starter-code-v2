# How it works

Email Service is a service built into starter-code-v2 that handles email sending functionality.

This could be used to send emails like welcome emails or password reset links.

The Typescript email service uses nodemailer with OAuth2 authentication and Gmail.

The Python email service uses OAuth2 authentication and the Gmail API.
