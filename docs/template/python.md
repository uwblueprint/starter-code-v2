# How to use this interface - Python

Link interface. Eg. [TypeScript User Auth interface](https://github.com/uwblueprint/starter-code-v2/blob/0e2d6af6ead206750c58f44d5d98e27c05428dfd/backend/typescript/services/interfaces/authService.ts)
What the function does, the params, and what it returns will already be found there.
Could also just copy/paste the interface here.

List all the methods included (if helpful can provide explanantion beyond what's included in the interface).
Think of a way each method might be used in the app & customized and write a short code sample. Explain when the method might be used.


### method_name(param1: string, param2: int)
